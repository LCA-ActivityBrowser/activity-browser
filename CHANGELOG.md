    Excel datasets. 

## [2.6.2] - 2020-12-14

### Changed

- ([#454](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/454))
    Allow for multiple databases to be relinked during the database relink action.
- ([#457](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/457))
    Explicitly use the brightway2 default fields for importing/exporting of
    Excel files, as this is something that will cause messes when not correctly
    lined up.
- ([#472](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/472))
    Improve the copying of values from tables in the AB, table headers are now
    included if the user is pressing the 'SHIFT' button. Also, simplify the
    database importer by creating a new separate 7z extraction method and routing
    the related methods through that.

### Fixed

- ([#464](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/464))
    Fixed an issue where the Monte Carlo analysis was unable to distinguish
    production and technosphere type changes made to the A matrix.
- ([#479](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/479))
    A number of bugfixes related to how parameters are handled, saved and deleted.

## [2.6.1] - 2020-09-28

### Added

- ([#445](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/445))
    Added importing of databases (and related parameters) through excel files.
    Added a way for users to relink databases with other databases after creating them.
- ([eeb7a16](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/eeb7a16b84f05c307c11479d95cf8d29e9b07fb0))
    Added a link to Youtube tutorials for the Activity Browser! See the README.

### Changed

- ([#445](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/445))
    Alter the import wizard to better separate 'download' options from 'local'
    import options. Some minor tweaks are included to improve the wizard.
- ([#453](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/453))
    Allow the renaming of an imported BW2Package database to take place within
    the import flow. This should drastically improve the speed for larger imports
    due to no longer requiring a `copy db` & `delete db` call.

### Fixed

- ([#452](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/452))
    Alter the `parameterize_exchanges` call to avoid performing a direct lookup
    on ActivityParameter objects, this should fix an issue where the parameter
    setup breaks when a parameter goes missing.
- ([c84e762](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/c84e7626c6fb5398526e405fcee6cbc8922446f9))

## [2.6.0] - 2020-08-31

### Added

- ([#425](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/425))
    __Added Global Sensitivity Analysis to the Activity Browser!__
    This feature allows the user to run a filtered GSA on the results of an
    earlier Monte Carlo sampling. This lets them have a closer look at which
    process and biosphere flows most affect the score of a particular
    reference flow and impact category combination.
- ([#393](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/393))
    Added special tooling that allows the Activity Browser to construct its
    own presamples-like arrays. These 'flow scenario' or 'superstructure' arrays
    allow users to construct their scenarios outside of python,
    allowing for quick testing and iteration of ideas.
- ([#394](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/394))
    Added logic to the parameter scenarios calculation button to allow
    exporting the resulting array into a flow scenario file. 
- ([#416](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/416))
    Added a special export button to the LCA results overview tab that allows
    users to export results for all different scenarios at once. (Only visible
    if the user is doing `Presamples` or `Scenario` LCAs)
- ([#428](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/428))
    Added tools to allow for 'on-the-fly' relinking of process flows as
    they are being imported with the 'local brightway file' import. This
    should make it even easier to share database files as the individual
    names of dependent databases are now no longer required to be completely
    the same. 

### Changed

- ([#412](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/412))
    It is now possible to have different kinds of the LCA calculation tabs of
    the same calculation setup open.
- ([#431](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/431))
    Users can now open the Activity Detail tab from the Calculation setup tab.

### Fixed

- ([#411](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/411))
    Make sure to only revert to the begin screen if the tab we're actually
    looking at is being hidden/deleted.
- ([#415](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/415))
    Plots/tables now stay hidden when the checkbox is unchecked and a tab is
    updated.
- ([#420](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/420))
    Fixed an error that would cause the AB to choke if the same reference flows
    from different databases (ie, copies) are run through an LCA calculation
    together.
- ([#423](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/423))
    Fixed the plot export button no longer doing anything. Export signalling
    is now rebuilt every time the plot is deleted and rebuilt.
- ([#426](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/426))
    Deleting an activity that has parameters attached to it will now correctly
    delete these parameters.
- ([#435](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/435))
    The activity `description` text is now correctly being updated when the user
    clicks outside the text box.

## [2.5.1] - 2020-04-30

### Added

- ([#356](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/356))
    Added Characterization Factor uncertainty handling. This allows users
    to edit the uncertainty of flows in Impact Category methods.
- ([#392](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/392))
    Allow removal of presamples packages through the Activity Browser. 

### Changed

- ([#376](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/376))
    The Monte Carlo calculation now allows fine-grained control over which
    uncertainties are sampled during the run.
- ([#383](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/383))
    Floats are now shortened to 5 significant decimals. More than one method
    can be removed at a time from the calculation setup methods table. 

### Fixed

- ([#357](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/357),
    [#366](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/366),
    [#379](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/379))
    A number of fixes related to the uncertainty wizard and editing
    uncertainty.
- ([#364](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/364))
    Fixes an issue with contribution analysis that could cause the
    calculation to slow down dramatically.
- ([#363](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/363))
    Attempt fix to MacOS platform that causes figures to be drawn incorrectly.
- ([#368](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/368))
    Near-complete refactoring of the code related showing the Sankey diagram.
    This should fix an issue where the graph was not being drawn correctly on
    initially opening the graph.
- ([#386](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/386))
    The AB now correctly generates contribution plots for processes from the
    FORWAST database.

## [2.5.0] - 2020-01-23

### Added

- ([#352](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/352))
    Added uncertainty wizard, which guides users in adding or changing the
    uncertainty of a process exchange or parameter. This addition includes
    some changes in how uncertainty is shown, by adding additional columns
    and hiding all uncertainty columns in exchange and parameter tables
    by default.
- ([cf04f2e](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/cf04f2eff61b3bffb92c2334d2fe0b742cd3c84d))
    A link to a scientific publication on the Activity Browser is now included
    in the readme.
- ([#341](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/341))
    Added the brightway2 `bw2test` decorator as a pytest fixture, allowing
    tests which use that fixture to be performed in a new and completely
    separate environment which is torn down after the test completes. Also
    includes tests for the new presamples Qt objects and some of the
    on-demand Qt widgets.
- ([#330](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/330))
    Added scenario analysis! It is now possible to create scenarios for
    parameters and store the calculated new exchange amounts for each
    scenario as a presamples package. It is also possible to select presamples
    packages created outside of the Activity Browser for use in LCA
    calculations. 
- ([#323](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/323))
    Make use of the builtin import/export fuctionality of brightway to
    allow quick imports and exports of databases. Note that there are a lot
    of rules and complications involved!

### Changed

- ([9352758](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/935275809945ee4f3a6c783e0f0062c9e5ec4922))
    Always show the MonteCarlo tab in LCA results, show a warning when
    running MonteCarlo on databases with incorrect uncertainty data. 
- ([#348](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/348))
    Moved metadata-changing signal connections out of the `MetaDataStore` class
    and into the `Controller` class.

    added tooltips for many of the related buttons. With thanks to
    [@e4BdSBmUzHowFico5Ktn](https://github.com/e4BdSBmUzHowFico5Ktn).
- ([#322](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/322))
    Updating the biosphere through the menu-option will now warn the user
    that the action is not reversible.
- ([#325](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/325))
    Changing the naming of 'LCIA methods' into 'Impact Categories'.
- ([#312](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/312))
    Slight changes to the main drop-down menu's, adding relevant icons to
    functionality.
- ([#315](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/315))
    Refactor code to use PySide2, use LGPL license.

    [#347](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/347),
    [#351](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/351))
    Numerous fixes related to the functioning of the dataset/database import wizard.
    Includes: a fix for [#333](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/333)
    and fixes aggregation of LCA results [#331](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/331).
- ([#340](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/340))
    It is now again possible to open multiple activities at once when selecting
    them from the database table.
- ([#339](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/339))
    Clearing the formula in the formula delegate will now properly signal
    the parameter recalculation, ensuring the same functionality as the
    'clear formula' action in the right-click menu.
- ([b08b9a8](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/b08b9a8351a6d2d4af54eab1e98f9b29e1a2ceca))

    new parameters to avoid sudden division by 0 errors.
- ([#327](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/327))
    Indexes in ParameterWizard now correctly set. Uncertainty type is
    grabbed from the exchanges instead of processes, as it should be.
    Code improvements to ensure filenames are 'safe' when exporting figures.

## [2.4.0] - 2019-10-30

### Added

- ([#260](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/260))
    Exposed the brightway2 parameterization functionality through the Activity
    Browser. This includes a custom formula creation delegate used by the
    existing exchange tables and the parameter tables in the new 'Parameters'
    tab. Please see the [brightway2 documentation](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/intro.html#parameterized-datasets)
    for a rundown of how to use parameters.
- ([#308](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/308))
    Added a small biosphere3 updater for users with long-running projects.
    This will allow users to update their biosphere3 database allowing the
    importer to correctly link never versions of ecoinvent. Also includes
    an exception handler which explicitly explains what to do when an ecoinvent
    import fails.

### Changed

- ([#297](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/297))
    Refactored settings code and moved relevant code from `app/bwutils/commontasks.py`
    into the settings classes themselves.

### Fixed

- ([#300](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/300))
    Perform searches on complete database inventory instead of previous
    search results.

- ([#309](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/309))
    Corrects an edge-case bug which causes the AB to complain when a calculation
    setup could not be found.
- ([#310](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/310))
    Fixes an edge-case issue caused by copying a process with only technosphere
    exchanges to a new database. Fixes the `copy to a different db` command,
    and add minor changes to ensure that copying to a large database is snappy.

## [2.3.4] - 2019-10-16

### Changed

- ([#279](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/279))
    and a follow-up commit ([6edb798](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/commit/6edb7982f6ef27bd7569c8b2464fe71cb7589a6f))
    disable the custom paint-delegate, due to it not functioning correctly
    on MacOS (issue [#278](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/278)).
- ([#281](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/281))
    A number of under-the-hood code tweaks were made which either streamline
    code or remove non-functional parts in the inventory table classes.
- ([#282](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/282))
    Closed a TODO in the tests, a mouseclick is now used to select the row
    and trigger a signal.
- ([#291](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/291))
    By splitting the test fixture into parts it became possible to unpin the
    the `pytest` version, allowing automated tests to take place on python 3.6
    and up!

### Fixed

- ([#283](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/283))
    Introduced a workaround for users with custom-bases databases which do not
    use a `location` field.
- ([#290](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/290))
    Link ecoinvent dataset-type to version explicitly to avoid key-errors.
- ([#293](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/293))
    With parameterization coming closer, a number of additional bugs and
    issues cropped up during testing. These fixes should remove most of the
    problems that arose by refactoring the tables to custom QTableViews.

## [2.3.3] - 2019-08-27

### Added

- ([#259](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/259))
    Subclassed the `Icons` class into `QIcons` which directly returns QIcon objects
    of the icon figures.

### Changed

- ([#256](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/256))
    Do not open the activity tab for activities without a product (ie. biosphere flows).
  - Includes tests!
- ([#258](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/258), [#261](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/261))
    Refactor the dataframe Model/View code to allow a lot of customization.
- ([#273](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/273))
    Filtering activities in the databases table is now case-insensitive: 'Gold' will
    now also find activities with 'gold' in them.
- Refactored all `ABTableWidget` classes to implement them as `ABDataFrameView` classes.
    See [#264](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/264),
    [#265](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/265),
    [#266](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/266),
    [#271](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/271),
    [#274](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/274).
    This fixes the issue of tables being sorted incorrectly.

### Fixed

- ([#246](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/246))
    Added a workaround for running LCA on databases with missing or unset uncertainty.
- ([#262](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/262))
    Database will no longer be deleted if the user selects `No` in the `delete_database`
    question dialog.
- ([#263](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/263))
    Add separate check of `database_changed` signal to ensure the correct table is refreshed.
- ([#267](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/267))
    Updating the metadata (by updating activities) will no longer throw errors.
- ([#231](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/231))
    Tables sorted on `float` or `integer`-type columns will now do so correctly instead of
    sorting the column by string.

### Removed

- ([#272](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/272))
    Removed `ConvenienceData` class as it has been completely replaced by the `MetaDataStore` class.
- ([#275](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/275))
    Removed unused `ABTableWidget` and `ABTableItem` classes, these have been completely
    replaced with the more flexible model/view implementation.

## [2.3.2] - 2019-07-03

### Added

- It is now possible to unpack tuple columns in the `MetaDataStore`, creating additional columns. ([#237](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/237))
- The results in the elementary flows and process contributions tabs can now be aggregated by their relevant columns. ([#239](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/239))
- This changelog file! ([#240](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/240))

### Changed

- Documented `MLCA` and `Contributions` classes according to [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) standards. ([#236](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/236))
- Importing the `biosphere3` database now casts all `categories` values to tuples. ([07a1cc3 in #237](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/237/commits/07a1cc381afe1ddfb8c97f54f7fc98af55dbedd3))
- Added methods to `MetaDataStore` class to simplify handling of the dataframe object inside. ([f95483c in #236](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/236/commits/f95483c03f216765f15def5ec7bce898a834b6a3))

### Fixed

- Cleaning up removed project directories ([#194](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/194), [#198](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/198)) can now be done by running the `activity-browser-cleanup` command in the anaconda prompt.
- Removed the line in the README file recommending people use the development version. Strip 'development' line from the recipe yaml when building a stable version. ([#241](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/241))
- Added method to `ProjectSettings` class to ensure the `read-only-databases` key is always present in the settings ([#235](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/235), [#242](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/242)). This fix also includes adding methods and calls to ensure new databases are added to- and removed from the settings.
- Allow users to add all (default) biosphere types to an activity instead of only exchanges of type 'emission'. ([#244](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/244))
