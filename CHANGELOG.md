# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.3] - 2019-08-27

### Added

- ([#259](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/259))
    Subclassed the `Icons` class into `QIcons` which directly returns QIcon objects
    of the icon figures.

### Changed

- ([#256](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/256))
    Do not open the activity tab for activities without a product (ie. biosphere flows).
  - Includes tests!
- ([#258](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/258), [#261](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/261))
    Refactor the dataframe Model/View code to allow a lot of customization.
- ([#273](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/273))
    Filtering activities in the databases table is now case-insensitive: 'Gold' will
    now also find activities with 'gold' in them.
- Refactored all `ABTableWidget` classes to implement them as `ABDataFrameView` classes.
    See [#264](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/264),
    [#265](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/265),
    [#266](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/266),
    [#271](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/271),
    [#274](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/274).
    This fixes the issue of tables being sorted incorrectly.

### Fixed

- ([#246](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/246))
    Added a workaround for running LCA on databases with missing or unset uncertainty.
- ([#262](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/262))
    Database will no longer be deleted if the user selects `No` in the `delete_database`
    question dialog.
- ([#263](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/263))
    Add separate check of `database_changed` signal to ensure the correct table is refreshed.
- ([#267](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/267))
    Updating the metadata (by updating activities) will no longer throw errors.
- ([#231](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/231))
    Tables sorted on `float` or `integer`-type columns will now do so correctly instead of
    sorting the column by string.

### Removed

- ([#272](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/272))
    Removed `ConvenienceData` class as it has been completely replaced by the `MetaDataStore` class.
- ([#275](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/275))
    Removed unused `ABTableWidget` and `ABTableItem` classes, these have been completely
    replaced with the more flexible model/view implementation.

## [2.3.2] - 2019-07-03

### Added

- It is now possible to unpack tuple columns in the `MetaDataStore`, creating additional columns. ([#237](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/237))
- The results in the elementary flows and process contributions tabs can now be aggregated by their relevant columns. ([#239](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/239))
- This changelog file! ([#240](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/240))

### Changed

- Documented `MLCA` and `Contributions` classes according to [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) standards. ([#236](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/236))
- Importing the `biosphere3` database now casts all `categories` values to tuples. ([07a1cc3 in #237](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/237/commits/07a1cc381afe1ddfb8c97f54f7fc98af55dbedd3))
- Added methods to `MetaDataStore` class to simplify handling of the dataframe object inside. ([f95483c in #236](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/236/commits/f95483c03f216765f15def5ec7bce898a834b6a3))

### Fixed

- Cleaning up removed project directories ([#194](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/194), [#198](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/198)) can now be done by running the `activity-browser-cleanup` command in the anaconda prompt.
- Removed the line in the README file recommending people use the development version. Strip 'development' line from the recipe yaml when building a stable version. ([#241](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/241))
- Added method to `ProjectSettings` class to ensure the `read-only-databases` key is always present in the settings ([#235](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/issues/235), [#242](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/242)). This fix also includes adding methods and calls to ensure new databases are added to- and removed from the settings.
- Allow users to add all (default) biosphere types to an activity instead of only exchanges of type 'emission'. ([#244](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/244))

## [2.3.1] - 2019-04-15

### Fixed

- Travis now correctly receives and handles a version tag.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-04-12

### Changed

- Major overhaul of the GUI. See [#218](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/pull/218) for details.
- New conda stable and development builds (`activity-browser`, `activity-browser-dev`) can now be found in the `bsteubing` [channel](https://anaconda.org/bsteubing/).
