# Activity Browser

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33026150/54299977-47a9f680-45bc-11e9-81c6-b99462f84d0b.png" width=100%/>

The **Activity Browser (AB) is an open source software for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** that builds on [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev).

[Video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsyySKrzEMsRFsWW1Oz-6aA/) are available on youtube.

Please also read and cite our [scientific paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2019.100012).


### Some highlights

- **Fast LCA calculations**: for multiple reference flows, impact categories, and scenarios
- **A productivity tool for brightway**: model in brightway (python) and see the results in the AB or vice-versa 
- **Advanced modeling:** Use parameters, scenarios (including prospective LCI databases from [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), uncertainties and our Graph Explorer
- **Advanced analyses:** Contribution analyses, Sankey Diagrams, Monte Carlo, and Global Sensitivity Analysis

# Installation

## The quick way

You can install and start the activity-browser like this:

```bash
conda create -n ab -c conda-forge activity-browser
conda activate ab
activity-browser
```

## The thorough way

| :warning: The activity browser has dropped support for python versions below `3.8`|
|---|
| You should re-install if you have an older installation of the activity browser which doesn't use `python >= 3.8` (you can check with `conda list` or `python --version` in your conda environment). You can remove your existing environment with `conda remove -n ab --all` or choose a new environment name (instead of `ab`). Re-installing will not affect your activity-browser/brightway projects. |

### Conda

We recommend that you use **conda** to manage your python installation. You can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or the more compact [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (Python 3 of course) for your operating system. Installation instructions for miniconda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). See also the [conda user guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) or the [Conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).

Skip this step if you already have a working installation of anaconda or miniconda, but make sure to keep your conda installation up-to-date: `conda update conda`.

### Add the Conda-Forge channel
The activity-browser has many dependencies that are managed by the [conda-forge](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html) channel. Open a cmd-window or terminal (in Windows you may have to use the Anaconda prompt) and type the following:

```bash
conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
```
### Install the AB with ecoinvent >=3.9
After prepending the Conda-Forge channel the following line should be executed within the command prompt/terminal to install the AB and it's dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n ab activity-browser
```
This will install the Activity Browser with the latest version of the Brightway2 libraries (currently excluding Brightway2.5 libraries).

### Install the AB with older ecoinvent versions (<3.9)

If you want to work with with older versions of ecoinvent (<3.9) in the AB, a different Biosphere3 database needs to be installed. This requires a _**different version of the bw2io library**_ to be installed, see also [here](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-io). Note that this version of bw2io can ONLY work with ecoinvent versions < 3.9. If you want to work with version > 3.9 AND < 3.9, the only solution currently available is to use two separate virtual environments (i.e. two AB installations).

To install a version of the AB that can handle ecoinvent versions <3.9, do the following: For a new installation from the conda-forge repository the same initial steps need to be made: Prepending the Conda-Forge repository in the channels, and installing the AB and dependencies. After the successful installation, the following two commands need to be executed before running the AB: <i>1)</i> Remove the latest version of the Brightway2 Input-Output library, <i>2)</i> Install an older version of the Brightway2 Input-Output library.

```bash
conda remove --force bw2io
conda install bw2io=0.8.7
```

#### Activity Browser is installed

At this point the activity-browser and all of its dependencies will be installed in a new conda environment called `ab`. You can change the environment name `ab` to whatever suits you.

# Updating the AB

We recommend to regularly update the AB to receive new features & bugfixes. These commands will update the activity-browser and all of its dependencies in the conda environment called `ab`.

```bash
conda activate ab
conda update activity-browser
```

# Getting started

## Running the AB

First activate the environment where the activity browser is installed:

```bash
conda activate ab
```

Then simply run `activity-browser` and the application will open.

## Importing LCI databases

- In the `Project`-tab there is initially a button called _"Add default data (biosphere flows and impact categories)"_. Click this button to add the default data. This is equivalent to `brightway2.bw2setup()` in python.
- After adding the default data, you can import a database with the _"Import Database"_-Button. Follow the instructions of the database import wizard. Imports can be done in several ways:
    - Directly from the ecoinvent homepage (ecoinvent login credentials required)
    - From a 7zip archive
    - From a directory with ecospold2 files (same as in brightway2)
    - From Excel files using the brightway Excel format

# Plugins

Since the `2.8 release` a plugin system has been added to the AB. Plugins are a flexible way to add new functionalities to the AB without modifying the software itself.

| :warning: DISCLAIMER |
|---|
| Plugins are not necessarily developped by Activity Browser maintainers. Below are listed plugins from people we trust but we do not check plugins code. **Use them at your own risk**. |
| The plugin system is still in developement so keep in mind that things may change at any point. |

## Existing plugins

These are plugins we know about. To add your plugin to the list open an issue or a pull request.

| Name | Description | Links | Author |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| template | An empty plugin to start from | [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/pan6ora/ab-plugin-template), [github](https://github.com/Pan6ora/activity-browser-plugin-template) | Rémy Le Calloch |
| Notebook | Use Jupyter notebooks from AB | [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/pan6ora/ab-plugin-template), [github](https://github.com/Pan6ora/ab-plugin-Notebook) | Rémy Le Calloch |
| ReSICLED | Evaluating the recyclability of electr(on)ic product for improving product design | [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/pan6ora/ab-plugin-resicled), [github](https://github.com/Pan6ora/ab-plugin-ReSICLED) | G-SCOP Laboratory |

## Installation

### detailed instructions

Every plugin's Github page should have a **Get this plugin** section with installation instructions.

### general instructions

Plugins are conda packages (like the Activity Browser). To add a plugin simply install it in your conda environment from the Anaconda repos.

_Nb: add `-c conda-forge` to the install command like below to avoid problems with dependencies._

Ex: 

```
conda activate ab
conda install -c pan6ora -c conda-forge ab-plugin-notebook
```

## Usage

Once a new plugin is installed restart the Activity Browser.

### enabling a plugin

Plugins are enabled **per-project**. Simply open the plugin manager in the `Tools > Plugins` menu. 

Close the plugin manager. New tabs should have appeared in the AB (each plugin can spawn one tab on each left/right panel).

### disabling a plugin

Disable a plugin the same way you activated it.

**:warning: Keep in mind that every data created by the plugin in a project could be erased when you disable it.**

## Development

The best place to start to create new plugins is the [plugin template](https://github.com/Pan6ora/activity-browser-plugin-template). Its code and README will help you to understand how to create a plugin.
