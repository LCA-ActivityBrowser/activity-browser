# Activity Browser - a GUI for Brightway2

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33026150/54299977-47a9f680-45bc-11e9-81c6-b99462f84d0b.png" width=100%/>

The activity browser is a graphical user interface for the [Brightway2](https://brightwaylca.org) advanced life cycle
assessment framework, making use of `Qt` through `Qt for Python` under the [LGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).

## Installation

### Miniconda

Install the newest python 3 version of [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for your operating system. Detailed installation instructions for miniconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).

Skip this step if you already have a working installation of anaconda or miniconda, but make sure to keep your conda installation up-to-date: `conda update conda`.

### Configure conda channels

The activity-browser has many dependencies and you need to add five [conda channels](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html) to your configuration file so conda can find all of them. Open a cmd-window or terminal and type the following (order is important):

```bash
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda config --append channels cmutel
conda config --append channels bsteubing
conda config --append channels haasad
conda config --append channels pascallesage
```

If you have already installed brightway2 before, chances are you already have these channels in your config file. You can check your channels with `conda config --show channels`. The output should look something like this if everything is set up correctly:

```bash
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
  - cmutel
  - bsteubing
  - haasad
  - pascallesage
```

### Install the activity browser

After configuring your conda channels, the activity browser can be installed with this command:

```bash
conda create --yes --name ab --channel conda-forge activity-browser
```

This will install the activity-browser and all of its dependencies in a new conda environment called `ab`. You can change the environment name `ab` to whatever suits you. Installing for the first time will take a few minutes.

It is recommended that you have a separate conda environment for the activity browser like explained above, but you can also install the activity browser in your root, brightway2 or other existing conda environment if you prefer. Having separate environments for different projects generally reduces unwanted side-effects and incompatibilities between packages. You can still access the same brightway-projects even if you work with different conda environments.

## Getting started

### Running the activity browser

First activate the environment where the activity browser is installed:

```bash
conda activate ab
```

Then simply run `activity-browser` and the application will open.

### Importing an LCI database

- In the `inventory`-tab there is a button called _"Add default data (biosphere flows and impact categories)"_. Click this button to add the default data. This is equivalent to `brightway2.bw2setup()` in python.
- After adding the default data, you can import a database with the _"Import Database"_-Button. Follow the instructions of the database import wizard. There are currently three types of imports possible:
    - Directly from the ecoinvent homepage (ecoinvent login credentials required)
    - From a 7zip archive
    - From a directory with ecospold2 files (same as in brightway2)

## Development Version
[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bsteubing/activity-browser-dev/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bsteubing/activity-browser-dev) [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bsteubing/activity-browser-dev/badges/downloads.svg)](https://anaconda.org/bsteubing/activity-browser-dev)

The most recent version of the master branch is automatically uploaded and generally available via conda ~5 minutes after being committed. Installation is the same as for the stable releases of the activity browser. It is highly advisable to not install the development version in the same conda environment as the stable release (the command `activity-browser` will always start the most recently installed version in a given environment).

Install the development version like this:

```bash
conda create --yes --name ab_dev --channel conda-forge --channel pascallesage activity-browser-dev
```

Or update like this if you already have a dev environment:

```bash
conda activate ab_dev
conda update --channel conda-forge --channel pascallesage activity-browser-dev
```

### Important Notice: the AB switched from PyQt5 to PySide2

After the 4th of november 2019 conda builds for the activity browser will make use of PySide2 instead of PyQt5.

#### Why?

- PySide2 is maintained and developed by [The Qt Company](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pyside-dev/pqwzngAGLWE),
and deemed more likely to be future-proof.
- PyQt5 [requires](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/introduction.html#license) that the Activity
Browser uses the GPL license, where PySide2 [allows](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/licenses.html#licenses-used-in-qt-for-python)
the Activity Browser to use a more permissive license.
  - Activity Browser is now published under the LGPL license, if a more permissive license is needed, please contact the developers.

#### What do I need to do if I have the AB-dev already installed?

You basically have 3 options:

1. Create a new environment entirely (recommended)
    ```bash
    conda create -n new_ab_dev -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c bsteubing -c haasad -c pascallesage activity-browser-dev
    ```
2. Remove PyQt5 and install PySide2 (within your existing environment)
    ```bash
    # Remove only the 'pyqt', 'matplotlib' and 'seaborn' packages
    conda remove --force pyqt matplotlib seaborn
    # Install the replacements from the conda-forge channel
    conda install -c conda-forge pyside2 matplotlib-base seaborn
    ```
3. Install PySide2 next to PyQt5 (we cannot guarantee this works due to possible environment differences)
    ```bash
    conda install pyside2
    ```
