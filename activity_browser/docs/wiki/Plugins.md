Since the `2.8.0` version, Activity Browser supports plugins. 
Plugins are a flexible way to add new functionalities to Activity Browser without modifying the software itself.

The plugin code has been designed and written by [Remy le Calloch](https://github.com/Pan6ora) 
(supported by [G-SCOP laboratories](https://g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/en/laboratory/g-scop-laboratory)) 
with revisions from the Activity Browser.

## Available plugins
> [!CAUTION]
> Plugins are not always developed by Activity Browser maintainers. 
> Below are listed plugins from people we know but we do not verify plugins.

## Installation
### Detailed instructions
Every plugin's webpage (links are provided in the above table) should have a **Get this plugin** section with installation instructions.

### General instructions
Plugins are often conda packages (like the Activity Browser). 
To add a plugin, install it in your conda environment.

> [!TIP]
> add `-c conda-forge` to the install command like below to avoid problems with dependencies.
>
> ```bash
> conda activate ab
> conda install -c pan6ora -c conda-forge ab-plugin-notebook
> ```

## Usage
Once a new plugin is installed restart the Activity Browser.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need help using a plugin or experience problems when using a plugin,
> contact the developers of the plugin, the Activity Browser team cannot help you.

### Enabling a plugin
Plugins are enabled **per project**. 
Simply open the plugin manager in the `Tools > Plugins` menu. 
Select the plugins you want to use and close the plugin manager. 
New tabs should have appeared in Activity Browser for each plugin.

### Disabling a plugin
Disable a plugin the same way you activated it.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep in mind that all data created by the plugin in a project could be erased when you disable it.

## Developing a plugin
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plugin system is still in development so keep in mind that things may change at any point.

To add your plugin to the list above either open an issue, or a pull request. 
All submitted plugins will be reviewed, although all risks associated with their use shall be born by the user.

The best place to start to create new plugins is the 
[plugin template](https://github.com/Pan6ora/activity-browser-plugin-template). 
Its code and README will help you to understand how to create a plugin.
