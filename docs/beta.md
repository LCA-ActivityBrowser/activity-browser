Thank you for showing interest in the Beta version of Activity Browser 3. This release has been a year in the making and we're happy to show of the hard work that's been put in and get it to a level where we're happy to show it to the wider public. Most notably AB3 will support Brightway25 and multifunctionality. But there have also been a lot of changes to the look and experience of the Activity Browser.

Making so many changes inevitably also comes with the risk of creating bugs. We have tried to catch as may of them as we could, but in the end noone is better at finding bugs than you, our users, are. We invite you to install the Activity Browser 3.0 Beta and break it in as many ways as you possibly can. As long as you report the bugs you find back to us, so we can fix them.

Thank you again for your help, and enjoy the new Activity Browser!
